I'm planning on creating a lite version of photoshop. It will allow users to complete some basic photo editing techniques as well as a few advanced ones, without the learning curve that including drawing and illustration techniques will add. 

It will contain content aware features that tailor their results to the userâ€™s selected photo, as well as basic features such as brightness/contrast manipulation, and black and white adjustment

The project will use Pillow for image manipulation and Kivy for the interface. 

Possibilities I'm considering for photo manipulation include:
Action recorder
BW conversion / adjustment by color channel
Brightness/contrast
Threshold conversion
Blur
Warp
Crop
Pinch to zoom in/zoom out
Blend images
Selection area
Undo/Redo ==> edit history
Smart select
Kivy UI Color wheel for color selection
Seam Carving
Convert image to polar coordinatesDraw/erase
Smudge tool
Various basic image adjustments
